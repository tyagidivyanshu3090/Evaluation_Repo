# üìù Commit 1: JavaScript bug

- Null is primitive type in javaScript but `typeof operator` shows it as Object
- NaN stands for "Not-a-Number", but ironically, its type is "number".
  - It is a special value that represents an invalid or undefined mathematical operation.

```js
console.log(0 / 0); // NaN
console.log(Math.sqrt(-1)); // NaN (because square root of negative numbers is not real)
console.log(parseInt("hello")); // NaN (cannot convert "hello" to a number)
```
